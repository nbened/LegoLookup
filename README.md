# Lego Lookup
#### I got a book called 'The Lego Engineer' with cool builds and parts listed but no LEGOs. This helped me source them.
#### Everything else I tried doesn't work. This program:
- #### allows you to store parts in objects of builds
- #### lookup prices of each part and therefore each build
- #### great for builds from books, old sets, and MOC's
